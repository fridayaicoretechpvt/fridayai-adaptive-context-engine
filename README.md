Adaptive Context Engine  
Friday AI | Research Preview  

This repository outlines the research foundation for the Adaptive Context Management Framework developed by the Friday AI Core Technologies team. This system is engineered to deliver emotionally intelligent responses in real time, optimized for scale, accuracy, and latency-sensitive workloads.

Overview  
The Adaptive Context Engine enables dynamic allocation of computational resources based on emotional complexity, eliminating the long-standing trade-off between context length and system performance in emotional AI systems.

Core Innovations

1. Logarithmic Context Scaling  
   - Efficient memory allocation across emotional complexity states  
   - Prevents memory explosion even at high user concurrency

2. Sparse Emotional Attention  
   - Emotionally significant tokens receive prioritized computation  
   - Delivers up to 4.4× performance improvement over fixed-window models

3. Domain-Aware State Compression  
   - Tailors compression thresholds to domain sensitivity  
   - Maintains emotional fidelity across healthcare, customer service, and creative tasks

| Method           | Avg. Context Size | Peak Memory | Latency (ms) | Accuracy | Speedup |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------|----------|---------|
| Fixed-small      | 512               | 1.0×        | 1.2          | 0.847    | 1.0×    |

Key Metrics  
- Latency reduction: sub-3 ms inference time  
- Context utilization: dynamic window scaling (64 – 16,384 tokens)  
- Peak memory usage: reduced by up to 67%  
- Deployment concurrency: linearly scalable to 10,000+ parallel interactions  
- Accuracy preservation: maintains >98% emotional understanding compared to baseline models  

Current Status  
The production framework currently supports up to 16,384 tokens in adaptive context scaling.  
Experimental models are under development to extend this capability beyond 500,000 tokens — designed to support long-range memory across sessions, documents, and multimodal inputs.

Usage  
This is a documentation-only repository. No source code is being released at this time. The framework is actively deployed within the Friday AI stack and is not publicly available for open-source or commercial integration.
